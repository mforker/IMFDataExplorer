# IMF Data Explorer

## 📌 Overview
IMF Data Explorer is a **Python Streamlit dashboard** that connects to the **IMF Data API**, making global financial data easily accessible. Users can:

✅ **Download raw financial data** in CSV format  
✅ **Visualize trends** with interactive graphs and plots  
✅ **Explore global economic indicators** without coding  

As a data analyst, I often struggled to find and download **global financial data in raw format**. Making API calls and processing the data was a challenge, so I built **IMF Data Explorer** to make it easier for others to **access, visualize, and download** IMF data without hassle.

This tool is built to help analysts, researchers, and businesses access and analyze financial data seamlessly.
